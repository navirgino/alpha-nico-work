if x > 50:
    y = 20
    z = 10




#Description: (B) An if statement that assigns 4 to the variable b and assigns 2 to the variable c
# if the variable a is less than 40.

#Declare Variables:
a = 0

#Begin Processing:

if a < 40:
    b = 4
    c = 2


#Descirption: (C) An if-else statement that assigns 0 to the variable b if the variable a is less
# than 10. Otherwise, 99 will be assigned to the variable b.
